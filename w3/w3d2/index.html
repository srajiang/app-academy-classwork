    <a name="Ingredients" /><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, separated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups mirepoix: 1 cup diced carrots, 1 cup diced celery, 1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 cups Private Selection Gourmet Baby Potatoes, chopped into small pieces (Use the baby red or baby gold potatoes)</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Directions" /><h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large pot over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the diced carrots,
      celery and onion and saute 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds more.</li>
      <li>Stir in the chopped potatoes, Italian seasoning, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce
      heat to medium, cover with lid and cook 15-20 minutes or until the veggies are crisp tender. Stir in broccoli and corn
      and cook 2-3 minutes longer or until veggies are tender and warmed through.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking
      constantly 1 minute. While whisking vigorously, slowly pour in milk (whisk well until smooth).</li>
      <li>Cook stirring constantly until mixture begins to gently boil and thicken and then stir in the heavy cream. Remove from
      heat and once all veggies are tender pour the milk/cream mixture into the vegetable soup and stir. Season to taste with
      salt and pepper. Lower heat to low and stir in the shredded cheese. Cook until cheese is melted. Serve warm with freshly
      chopped parsley or thyme and bread!</li>
